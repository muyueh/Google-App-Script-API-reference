# Google-App-Script-API-reference

## Repository layout

- `source/` — canonical markdown files for each Google Workspace service. Edit or add
  files here.
- `complete/` — autogenerated full documentation organized by section.
- `keywords/` — autogenerated keyword-focused summaries of each service.
- `generate_keyword_versions.py` — regeneration script.

## Regenerating docs

1. Edit the files under `source/` (for example `source/calendar.md`).
2. Run `python3 generate_keyword_versions.py` from the repository root. The script now
   reads exclusively from `source/` and recreates the `complete/` and `keywords/`
   directories, deleting any previous output.
